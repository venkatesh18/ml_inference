# Machine Learning Inference

```
This repository contains codes for performing machine learning model inference 
using EC2 instances. 
Examples of GPU based model inference are provided in the /gpu folder. 
Model inference with AWS Inferentia can found in the /inf folder. 

Each of these folders contain two examples, namely:
1. RESNET
2. DISTILBERT

Instructions for executing the model scripts can be found in the README files in 
their respective folders.
